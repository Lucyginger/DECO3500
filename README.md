# Using Prototype
- [Link to the 2D prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/9jDt6JrKnJecJ25v6rwAfq/CLAY-team-library?node-id=447%3A3985&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=447%3A3985)
- The prototype is built on figma and the play function of figma enables you to see the effect of navigating between functional pages.The main features of this version are the project's homepage, the 2D version of the library, the movie feature, the mini-game feature and the community communication feature.
- The homepage simulates scenes of different iconic buildings on the UQ campus and jumps to different functions when clicked.
- Jump to the individual study room screen by clicking on the tables and chairs on the 2D library page and find out how much time you are currently focusing on studying via the timer board. And you can see the library in 3D by using the turn 3D button, giving a more realistic experience and allowing users to interact and chat in the 3D interface.
- Features that add to the interactive user experience such as the cinema, where pop-up messages can be sent. Extensions include, you draw and I guess mini games.
- The forum provides a platform for the exchange of interests and questions, with ranking to find the users with the most points using the app.

- The main content of this link is the 3D version of the Central Library. Built on unity, the entire model is shown in video form to show how it looks and how it is explored from the ground floor to the first floor in an active view.
